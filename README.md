A Decentralized Telecommunications Network

Today, October 25, 2024, following the release of fraudulent presidential election results in Mozambique, all mobile operators have had their internet services shut down.

This same week, citizens have been staging protests, demanding democracy, with social media being the main platform for communication. It's also through social media that evidence of human rights violations, electoral fraud, and corruption by the current regime is being shared.

Shutting down mobile internet is a common tactic used to suppress protests and demonstrations in many countries.

So far, there is no effective way to bypass this. There are several anti-censorship measures, but most are based on the application layer or on a layer above mobile operators.

What I mean is that as long as we rely on mobile operators for communication, we will always be vulnerable to censorship.

I am here to suggest the development of a telecommunication solution that can replace mobile operators in moments like these, and ideally, replace them permanently.

I have been thinking about this for two years, but now I have decided to take the first steps toward it. For now, I want to hear from you â€” how can we build this?

Right now, I want to prepare a whitepaper for this, and I would not like to do it alone. I am counting on all of you.
